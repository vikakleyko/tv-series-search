# Things I would improve if I had more time:

- spend more time working on improving the style for both views (both in mobile and desktop versions)
- add debouncing (ex useDebouce hook) to limit the amount of times a task occurs and improve the efficiency of your application
- improve usability (for example, add a spinner while waiting for a response in case of slow internet, show "no result" message in case of bad query, etc.)
- store the input value the user enters into local storage, React Context, etc. to be able to keep the search result when switch between components
